# Pet-Sales-Analysis
This Project consolidates dog and cat breed data into an Excel workbook with separate sheets for sales averages and summaries. Analyze breed popularity, compute average prices, determine temperament modes, and create pivot charts with slicers for enhanced data interaction.

## TASK
##### TASK 1: I have a structured data of dog and cat breeds. I want you to do the following:
Consolidate dog and cat breeds list in 1 Excel file. Create 1 worksheet for cats and another worksheet for dogs.
1.	Add a column to both worksheets called “Average Sales” and compute for the average sales for each cat and dog breed.
2.	Add another worksheet called “Summary”
3.	Display total count of cats per fur type.
4.	Display total count of dogs per group1 category.
5.	Using Excel functions, display the following breeds. Display the top and bottom breeds with 1-10 Popularity:
    - Top 10 cat breeds based on popularity
    - Top 10 dog breeds based on popularity
    - Bottom 10 cat breeds based on popularity
    - Bottom 10 dog breeds based on popularity

Note that there can be multiple breeds with the same popularity, output can be more than 10 breeds.

6.	Compute for the average price of:
a.	Top 10 and bottom 10 cat breeds and
b.	Top 10 and bottom 10 dog breeds
Round off to the nearest 2 decimal places only.

    - Cat breeds
    - Dog breeds

8.	Print the following:
a.	Total count of cats which have an 
b.	affectionate temperament

9.	Create/ formulate 2 more summaries based on your own analysis.


##### TASK 2: Given the structured and consolidated data of dog and cat breeds, I want you to do the following:
1.	Create a pivot chart for cat breeds and display the following:
    - Total count of cat breeds per fur type.
    - Total count of cat breeds with and without “affectionate” temperament”
    - Add a slicer based on lap cat column
2.	Create a pivot chart for dog breeds and display the following:
    - Total count of dog breeds per Group 2
    - Total count of dogs with and without “affectionate” temperament
    - Add a slicer based on group 1 column
3.	Add more slicers or filters based on your own analysis
